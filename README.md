# 🎵 RhythmMind - AI-Powered Music Player  

## 📌 Overview
RhythmMind is an AI-driven music player that dynamically curates playlists based on BPM, rhythm, and mood analysis. It leverages machine learning techniques to personalize music experiences, continuously optimizing recommendations through user interactions.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript (React Native/Flutter TBD)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Librosa (for audio processing)
- **Backend**: FastAPI/Django/Node.js (TBD)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Firebase
- **Cloud Services**: AWS/GCP/Azure (TBD)
- **Mobile Development**: React Native/Flutter (TBD)  

## 🚀 Key Features
- **🎶 AI-Powered Playlists** – Adaptive music selection based on real-time mood & BPM analysis
- **🔄 Reinforcement Learning** – Continuously improves recommendations from user behavior
- **🎚 Tempo & Mood Sync** – Matches song selection to current activity (e.g., workout, relaxation)
- **📊 Data-Driven Insights** – Tracks listening trends and patterns
- **📱 Modern UI/UX** – Intuitive design for seamless interaction  

## 📌 System Architecture
1. **Frontend** (React Native/Flutter): User interface and interactions
2. **Backend API** (FastAPI/Django/Node.js): Handles requests and ML model integration
3. **ML Engine** (TensorFlow/PyTorch): Processes song features and user preferences
4. **Database** (PostgreSQL/Firebase): Stores user data, preferences, and song metadata
5. **Cloud Services** (AWS/GCP/Azure): Manages storage, AI model deployment, and scalability

## 🚀 Installation & Setup (TBD)

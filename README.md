# 🎵 RhythmMind - AI-Powered Music Player  

## 📌 Overview
RhythmMind is an AI-driven music player designed primarily for users who store music locally, offering a deeply personalized listening experience without relying on streaming services. Unlike traditional platforms like Spotify, which rely on algorithmic auto-playlists, RhythmMind allows you to chat with your music—just like you would with a real DJ or a friend who knows your taste.
<br>

## How RhythmMind Understands You
** Instead of manually searching for songs, you can simply tell RhythmMind what you're feeling:
- "I'm in the mood for West Coast beats." – AI curates a playlist with tracks that match that style. 
- "Give me songs that sound like Tattoo by Fireboy." – AI finds similar tracks based on melody, instrumentation, and rhythm. 
- "I want acrobatic flows." – AI detects high-energy tracks with fast-paced rapping or vocals. 
- "Take me back to summer 2021." – AI remembers the songs you loved at that time and recreates the vibe.
